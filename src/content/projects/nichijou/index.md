This is my personal nix / flake configuration for all systems, including a NixOS workstation, a Macbook Pro, and a Mac Mini. I use home-manager to manage my user environment and nix-darwin to manage macOS. I regularly update this repository with new modules and configurations, which may be useful for others. But I don't recommend using it directly as your flake input, because it is highly customized for my personal use and is subject to frequent changes. Feel free to copy and adapt any parts of it to your own configuration.
